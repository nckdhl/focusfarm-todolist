     Culminating Assignment - PHP and Javascript

     Name of App: FocusFarm

    << CHANGELOG >>>

    - This app as I laid it out in the original plan was considerably more time-consuming than
      originally planned, I therefore had to cut out alot of the promised functionality
    - Basically the project was reduced to a simple ToDo list app with a nice UI

    << CHANGES FROM PROJECT PLAN >>

    1. NO Pomodoro style timer - The project was reduced to simply a ToDo list app
    2. Tags will be functional in memory, but not in the database. You therefore also can't filter by tags.
    3. No filter by categories or date as the functionality was left out.
    4. No music player.
    5. No saveable settings for the user.
    6. Database schema is reduced to 3 tables - user, list_item and list
    7.

    << CHANGES FROM SECURITY AUDIT >>

    1. Try-catch error handling was not implemented on the PHP side as all potential errors are handled gracefully by the front-end

    << CHANGES FROM THE JQUERY INTEGRATION PLAN >>

    - I was not able to implement JQuery at all because it was impossible to integrate with the way I built
    my components without a full re-write of my project

    - Unfortunately I saved JQuery to the end of the project and found out the hard way a few things that
    made it impossible to include

    - When I create DOM elements in JQuery and render them to the DOM or save to memory they are then
    instantiated as JQuery objects and not pure HTML Node objects according to the WEB API.
    Therefore, as soon as I create Node elements in my component classes using JQuery it breaks everything
    because I can't use vanilla JS Node functions and methods on those objects as they become JQuery objects
    that only accept JQuery operations

    - I access all my DOM elements dynamically using assigned objects and variables and I would have to use JQuery
    for all DOM manipulation and Element creation

    - This would have taken too long to do given the size and structure of my JS files and therefore I left it out
    as it is 9 pm on Friday the 6th and I've spent several hours already trying to implement it

    - I thought I could have just integrated JQuery on select parts of my project but the modular structure
    of my JS made this impossible
